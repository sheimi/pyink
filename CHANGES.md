# Pyink Changelog

All notable changes to Pyink are recorded here.

## Unreleased

* Existing parentheses around strings are no longer removed if the content does
  not fit on a single line. This is related to
  https://github.com/psf/black/pull/3640 where we still want to keep the
  parentheses around the implicitly concatenated strings if the code already
  uses them, making it more obvious it's a single function argument.
* `--pyink-lines=` now works with stdin inputs (#16).

## 23.3.1

* In multiline module docstrings, trailing quotes that are put on their own line
  are now kept on their own line. (#8)

## 23.3.0

This release is based on Black v23.3.0.

* Pyink now requires Black v23.3.0 (for blib2to3).

## 23.1.1

This release is based on https://github.com/psf/black/commit/9c8464ca7ddd48d1c19112d895ae12d783f01563.

* Fixed a bug where a module docstring ends with a line that's `LineLength-3`
  to `LineLength` long, an extra empty line was added.
* Fixed a bug when running *Pyink* on Python 3.8 and earlier (#3).
* Do not explode immediately nested literals that have a trailing comma in the
  body.

  `# fmt: off/on` are used outside of the line ranges.
* Fixed a bug in incremental formatting (`--pyink_lines=`) when part of the
  match statement is changed.

## 22.12.0

This release is based on
https://github.com/psf/black/commit/96e62c57e3023977de177a8ba34678007a63f1fe
(two bugfix commits ahead of Black v22.12.0).

* Prefer splitting right hand side of assignment statements
  (see [psf/black#1498](https://github.com/psf/black/issues/1498), this is being
  upstreamed in [psf/black/pull/3368](https://github.com/psf/black/pull/3368)).
